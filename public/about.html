<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Qi Wu, a third-year Computer Science student at UCSB. Originally from
  the vibrant city of Shanghai, China, I've brought my cultural heritage and
  passion for learning to sunny California. My journey in computer science has
  been exciting and rewarding, with Python, C++, and JavaScript as my main
  programming languages.

  One of my biggest passions is cooking. I love experimenting in the kitchen,
  especially baking cakes. Cooking for my family every day brings me immense joy
  and satisfaction. There's something special about sharing a meal that I've
  prepared with my loved ones. Dancing is another activity that I cherish.
  Whether it's a formal dance class or just grooving to my favorite tunes,
  dancing helps me stay active and express myself creatively.

  I'm an ESTP, which stands for Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving. This
  personality type means I thrive in dynamic environments, love meeting new
  people, and am always up for an adventure. My friends are a significant part
  of my life, and I enjoy spending time with them, whether it's studying
  together, exploring new places, or just hanging out.

  As a big fan of science fiction, "Three Body" has captivated me with its
  intricate plot and thought-provoking themes. I highly recommend the anime
  adaptation of "My Three-Body" to anyone interested in a thrilling sci-fi
  experience.

  In addition to my academic and personal interests, I have a keen interest in
  makeup. I enjoy experimenting with different looks and techniques, finding it
  a fun and creative outlet. Being a quick learner has always been one of my
  strengths, allowing me to pick up new skills and adapt to different situations
  with ease.
